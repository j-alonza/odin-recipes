    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These Crispy Potato skins are topped with smoked bacon, green onions, and plenty 
        of sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack Cheese. They are easy to prepare and so much 
        better than the restaurants. This is one of our favorite go-to appetizers and is 
        perfect for football season and entertaining. Be sure to read my tips and recipe 
        notes for good crispy skins.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 small to medium Russet Potatoes</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons canola oil or olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ cup finely shredded cheddar</li>
        <li>½ cup finely shredded Monterey Jack</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon crispy cooked and chopped</li>
        <li>1 green onion finely sliced</li>
        <li>sour cream (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
        <li>Scrub, dry and poke the potatoes 8-10 times using the tines of a fork.  Using your hands rub the potatoes with a little canola oil or olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt. Place them on a baking sheet. Bake potatoes for 50-60 minutes or until they are cooked through.  Let them sit until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>APreheat oven to 450 degrees. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon scoop out the flesh out leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch around the inside of the skin.</li>
        <li>Top evenly with both cheeses and bacon.  Return to oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Top with green onions and sour cream (optional). Serve promptly.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil then bake the spaghetti for 30 minutes. Top the spaghetti with chopped parsley, if desired. Slice into six pieces, then serve!</li>
    </ol>
